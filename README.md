## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned
I learned a lot about graphs and charts, using them with react and Typescript. Also, getting
better working with Vite and Flexbox.

### Continued development
I want to continue learning more about graphs and charts, using them in different pages
and settings. Learning more about styling graphs and using data in a systematic way.
